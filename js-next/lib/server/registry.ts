/**
 * Process-local registry for the agent and its per-thread sessions.
 *
 * Next.js route handlers are stateless per request, and the dev server
 * re-evaluates modules on hot reload. Stashing the agent and the session map on
 * `globalThis` keeps a single agent instance (and therefore a single
 * `MemorySaver` checkpointer) alive across requests and reloads, so a thread's
 * conversation state survives between the `/state`, `/commands`, and `/stream`
 * calls that make up one turn.
 *
 * NOTE: This is in-memory and process-local. A serverless/multi-instance
 * deployment needs a durable checkpointer (Postgres, SQLite, …) and a shared
 * session/replay store. The wiring here stays the same; only the checkpointer
 * in `lib/agent/index.ts` and this store change.
